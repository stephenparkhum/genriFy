genriFy allows you to find the top artists in a specific genre on Spotify. This is 

## Goal
This app stemmed from personal interest in finding out who was the most played, and "most popular" artist within a particular genre on Spotify. 

This also potentially helps you discover more artists in genres you were unaware of or artists in a particular city. 

Spotify have a list of 126 "default" genres, but often digital distribution systems (and record labels) add their own "custom" genres to their submissions. Therefore, I suggest that users try out random genre tags that may return artists. I.e., Searching for 'NYC' or 'Portland metal' returns quite a few artists in that particular region. 

genriFy is currently only available to Spotify users - a sign-in is required.
